Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks. 

Twilio uses webhooks to let your application know when events happen, such as receiving 
an SMS message or getting an incoming phone call. When the event occurs, Twilio makes 
an HTTP request (usually a POST or a GET) to the URL you configured for the webhook. 
Twilio's request will include details of the event such as the incoming phone number or 
the body of an incoming message.

Webhooks allow the applications to respond for certain events.
Three paticipants: Event Sender, Webhook Provider and Application (Webhook Handler)

Webhook Setup:
The Application (Webhook Handler) developer log in to the Webhook Provider console (Twilio) 
and create the webhook with the callback URL (aka the application URL).


Webhook Flow:

               initiate event                      call application
Event Sender  ----------------> Webhook Provider  ------------------> Application
              <---------------- (Twilio)          <------------------ (Webhook Handler)
               response                            response


Webhook scenarios:
1. Mobile app sends a SMS/MMS message to a phone number registered with Twilio. A SMS/MMS 
   message is sent to the mobile phone as response.
2. A phone is made to a phone number registered with Twilio. A voice reply
   is sent to the phone as response.
3. A SMS/MMS message is dilivered to a mobile. Twilio calls back the application to
   report the delivery status of the message, and the application may just log it.
