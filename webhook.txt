Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks. 

Twilio uses webhooks to let your application know when events happen, such as receiving 
an SMS message or getting an incoming phone call. When the event occurs, Twilio makes 
an HTTP request (usually a POST or a GET) to the URL you configured for the webhook. 
Twilio's request will include details of the event such as the incoming phone number or 
the body of an incoming message.
