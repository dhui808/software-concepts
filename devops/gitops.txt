GitOps is a way of implementing Continuous Deployment for cloud native applications.

The core idea of GitOps is having a Git repository that always contains declarative descriptions 
of the infrastructure currently desired in the production environment and an automated process 
to make the production environment match the described state in the repository. If you want to 
deploy a new application or update an existing one, you only need to update the repository - 
the automated process handles everything else.

GitOps: versioned CI/CD on top of declarative infrastructure. Stop scripting and start shipping.
