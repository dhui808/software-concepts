### Include another HTML file

### URL Encoding (Percent Encoding)
    URL encoding converts characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet.
    URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set.
    Since URLs often contain characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted into a valid ASCII format.
    URL encoding replaces unsafe ASCII characters with a "%" followed by two hexadecimal digits.
    URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign or with %20.
