### Blockchain
	Blockchains are Distributed, Write Once Read Only Networked Database Systems.
	The fundamental strengths of a blockchain system is in it's data integrity and networked immutability. 
	These are achieved through distributing redundancies across an active network, and performing validation checking, 
	through consensus, before writing new data to the blockchain nodes. These are the two pillars that differentiate 
	blockchain from other types of systems (such as distributed ledgers).
