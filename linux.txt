1. delete all .svn folder:
first check:
find . -name .svn -exec ls {} \;
Then:
find . -name .svn -exec rm -rf {} \;
( {} expands to the filename of each file or directory found with find )
( Semicolon ; ends the command executed by exec. It needs to be escaped with \ so that the shell you run find
inside does not treat it as its own special character, but rather passes it to find. )

or
find . -name .svn | xargs rm -fr
