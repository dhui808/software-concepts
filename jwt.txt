### Opaque Access Tokens
    Opaque access tokens are tokens in a proprietary format that you cannot access and typically contain some identifier 
    to information in a server's persistent storage.  To validate an opaque token, the recipient of the token needs to 
    call the server that issued the token.

### JWT access tokens
    JSON Web Token (JWT) access tokens conform to the JWT standard and contain information about an entity in the form of 
    claims. They are self-contained therefore it is not necessary for the recipient to call a server to validate the token.
