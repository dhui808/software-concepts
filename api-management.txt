API management is the process of designing, publishing, documenting and analyzing APIs in a secure environment.

API management solutions allow users to perform the following tasks:

API design - API management solutions provide users – from developers to partners – the ability to design, publish and deploy APIs as well as record documentation, 
security policies, descriptions, usage limits, runtime capabilities and other relevant information. 

API gateway - API management solutions also serve as an API gateway, which acts as a gatekeeper for all APIs by enforcing relevant API security policies and 
requests and also guarantees authorization and security. 

API store - API management solutions provide users with the ability to keep their APIs in a store or catalog where they can expose them to internal and/or external
stakeholders. This API “store” then serves as a marketplace for APIs, where users can subscribe to APIs, obtain support from users and the community and so on. 

API analytics - API management allow users to monitor API usage, load, transaction logs, historical data and other metrics that better inform the status as well as
the success of the APIs available.
