### Session cookie
    A session cookie does not hav an expiration time.
    The cookie's lifespan is tied to the duration of the user's browsing session. 
    As long as the user keeps interacting with the website and the session is active, 
    the session cookie will remain valid.
    
    Looks like there is no clear definition about when a session expires.
    My intepretation is that a session cookie does not expire until it is replaced by 
    another session cookie.
