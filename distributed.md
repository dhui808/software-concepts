### RESTful services and message systems
    RESTful services are a good choice when you want a simple, stateless communication model that is 
    based on HTTP and resource representation. 
    
    Message systems are a good choice when you need asynchronous, decoupled communication between 
    producers and consumers, and when you don't need a uniform interface for resource manipulation.
    
    The main differences between RESTful services and message systems are:

    Communication model: RESTful services use a request-response model, where a client sends a request 
    and the server responds with a representation of the resource. Message systems use a publish-subscribe 
    or message queueing model, where messages are sent asynchronously and consumed by one or more 
    subscribers or consumers.

    Statelessness: RESTful services are stateless, meaning that each request contains all the necessary 
    information for the server to process it. Message systems can be stateful or stateless, depending on 
    the implementation.

    Resource representation: RESTful services typically use JSON or XML to represent resources, while 
    message systems can use any format that is agreed upon by the producers and consumers.

    API design: RESTful services use a uniform interface, where resources are identified by URIs and 
    manipulated using HTTP methods. Message systems do not have a uniform interface, but instead rely 
    on the producers and consumers agreeing on the message format and protocol.
