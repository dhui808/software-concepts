### RESTful services and message systems
    RESTful services are a good choice when you want a simple, stateless communication model that is 
    based on HTTP and resource representation. 
    
    Message systems are a good choice when you need asynchronous, decoupled communication between 
    producers and consumers, and when you don't need a uniform interface for resource manipulation.
    
    The main differences between RESTful services and message systems are:

    In RESTful services, the client communicates with the server directly.
    In messaging systems, the producer fo not communicate with the consumers directly. They are decoupled.
    
    RESTful services are suitable for realtime processing.
    Messaging systems are suitable for batch processing (not realtime).
